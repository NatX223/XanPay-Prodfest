# Design Document

## Overview

The bank details payout page will be implemented as a React Native screen within the existing XanPay app architecture. It will follow the established design patterns using the existing color scheme, form components, and navigation structure. The page will provide a secure and user-friendly interface for users to configure their bank account information for fiat settlement payouts.

## Architecture

### Component Structure
- **BankDetailsPage**: Main screen component that handles the overall layout and navigation
- **BankDetailsForm**: Form component containing the bank selection and account number inputs
- **BankDropdown**: Custom dropdown component for bank selection
- **AccountNumberInput**: Enhanced input component with numeric validation
- **BankDetailsService**: Service layer for API calls and data persistence

### Navigation Integration
The page will be integrated into the existing tab navigation structure, likely accessible from the dashboard or as a modal/stack screen when users initiate a fiat settlement process.

## Components and Interfaces

### BankDetailsForm Component
```typescript
interface BankDetailsFormProps {
  initialData?: BankDetails;
  onSubmit: (data: BankDetails) => Promise<void>;
  onCancel?: () => void;
  isLoading?: boolean;
}

interface BankDetails {
  bankCode: string;
  accountNumber: string;
  isVerified?: boolean;
  lastUpdated?: Date;
}
```

### BankDropdown Component
```typescript
interface BankDropdownProps {
  value: string;
  onValueChange: (value: string) => void;
  error?: string;
  disabled?: boolean;
}

interface BankOption {
  code: string;
  name: string;
  displayName: string;
}
```

### Bank Options Data
The dropdown will include major US banks with 3-4 letter codes:
- BOA (Bank of America)
- JPM (JPMorgan Chase)
- WFC (Wells Fargo)
- USB (US Bank)
- COF (Capital One)
- PNC (PNC Bank)
- TFC (Truist Financial)
- GS (Goldman Sachs)

## Data Models

### BankDetails Model
```typescript
interface BankDetails {
  id?: string;
  userId: string;
  bankCode: string;
  bankName: string;
  accountNumber: string; // Encrypted in storage
  accountNumberMasked: string; // For display (****1234)
  isActive: boolean;
  isVerified: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### Validation Rules
- **Bank Code**: Required, must be from predefined list
- **Account Number**: Required, numeric only, 8-17 digits (typical US account number range)
- **Form State**: Both fields required for submission

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors
- Real-time validation for account number format
- Clear error messages below each field
- Form-level validation before submission
- Visual indicators for invalid fields

### API Error Handling
- Network connectivity issues
- Server validation failures
- Authentication/authorization errors
- Graceful degradation with retry options

### Error Messages
```typescript
const ErrorMessages = {
  BANK_REQUIRED: 'Please select a bank',
  ACCOUNT_INVALID: 'Account number must contain only numbers',
  ACCOUNT_LENGTH: 'Account number must be 8-17 digits',
  ACCOUNT_REQUIRED: 'Account number is required',
  SAVE_FAILED: 'Failed to save bank details. Please try again.',
  NETWORK_ERROR: 'Network error. Please check your connection.',
};
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Form validation logic
- Input sanitization and formatting
- Error state handling
- Component rendering with different props

### Integration Tests
- Form submission flow
- API integration with backend
- Navigation between screens
- Data persistence and retrieval

### E2E Tests
- Complete user flow from navigation to successful save
- Error scenarios and recovery
- Form state management across app lifecycle
- Accessibility compliance testing

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Account numbers encrypted before storage using AES-256
- Sensitive data cleared from memory after use
- No logging of sensitive information
- Secure transmission over HTTPS

### Input Sanitization
- Strict numeric validation for account numbers
- XSS prevention for all text inputs
- SQL injection prevention in backend queries

### Authentication
- Require active user session
- Re-authentication for sensitive operations
- Session timeout handling

## UI/UX Design

### Visual Design
- Consistent with existing app theme using OnboardingColors
- Glass morphism effects matching current design language
- Proper spacing and typography using Clash font family
- Accessible color contrast ratios

### User Experience
- Progressive disclosure of information
- Clear visual feedback for all interactions
- Intuitive form flow with logical tab order
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

### Accessibility
- Screen reader support with proper labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast mode compatibility
- Voice control compatibility

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization
- Lazy loading of bank options data
- Debounced validation to reduce unnecessary API calls
- Efficient re-rendering with React.memo where appropriate
- Minimal bundle size impact

### Caching Strategy
- Cache bank options locally
- Store form state during navigation
- Implement offline capability for viewing saved details
